    "title": "The Swiss energy transition: Policies to address the Energy Trilemma_Weiss_Pareschi_Georges_Boulouchos.pdf",
    "summary": "This paper presents a power market model examining Switzerland's energy transition by coupling electricity markets of five interconnected European countries (Switzerland, Austria, Germany, Italy, and France). The study analyzes how various international policies (including carbon taxation, fuel prices, and cross-border transmission capacity expansion) and national policies impact Switzerland's electricity supply, CO2 emissions, consumer costs, and security of supply - collectively known as the Energy Trilemma. The research is particularly significant because Switzerland's electricity supply is currently almost CO2-free, consisting mainly of nuclear power and hydropower (approximately 35% and 60% respectively), with the country serving as a crucial central hub for European electricity transmission. The authors simulate three different scenarios: a Reference scenario, RES+ (increased renewable energy support), and NUC+ (extended nuclear power), evaluating each against the Energy Trilemma dimensions. Key findings indicate that while the Reference scenario results in the highest CO2 emissions, the NUC+ scenario offers the best combination of low emissions and consumer costs, though it faces regulatory and social approval challenges. The RES+ scenario, which focuses on boosting solar power, reduces emissions but increases consumer costs. All scenarios demonstrate the need for a Strategic Reserve to ensure security of supply compliance. The study's unique contribution lies in its analysis of the dynamic interactions between policy instruments (such as renewable support schemes and nuclear phase-out plans) and market players' investment decisions, providing valuable insights for other European countries with significant hydropower resources considering nuclear phase-outs. The research emphasizes the importance of understanding policy and market player interplay for achieving decarbonization goals effectively.\n\nDomain-specific terms and their synonyms:\n- Energy Trilemma (sustainability, affordability, security of supply)\n- Strategic Reserve (capacity mechanism, backup power)\n- RES (Renewable Energy Sources, clean energy)\n- Cross-border transmission capacities (power interconnections, grid connections)"

    "title": "The role of digital social practices and technologies in the Swiss energy transition towards net-zero carbon dioxide emissions in 2050_Stermieri_Kober_McKenna_Schmidt_Panos.pdf",
    "summary": "text focusing on the role of digitalization in Switzerland's energy transition:\n\nThe study examines how digital social practices and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can contribute to Switzerland's goal of achieving net-zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. The research combines two models: the Swiss TIMES Energy Systems Model (STEM) and a socio-technical-economic agent-based model (SEED) to analyze long-term energy transition pathways while considering both social and technical factors.\n\nKey findings reveal that increased digitalization has a net-positive impact on Switzerland's energy transition, with a digitally-oriented society requiring 10-20% less energy in 2050 compared to maintaining 2020 digitalization levels. While digital practices like teleworking (remote work) and e-commerce can create rebound effects in residential energy use, these are offset by efficiency gains and process optimizations enabled by ICTs.\n\nThe research is particularly relevant for Switzerland, which combines ambitious climate targets (including net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050) with a Digitalization Strategy implemented in 2019. The country faces unique challenges due to its planned nuclear phase-out and limited domestic carbon-free resources, making it an ideal case study for examining digitalization's role in energy transition.\n\nThe study emphasizes that successful implementation requires policy support in three key areas: developing population digital skills, digitalizing services, and expanding network infrastructure. This represents a more comprehensive approach compared to previous research, which often focused on single sectors or failed to account for cross-sectoral interactions and social dynamics.\n\nThe methodology's innovation lies in its integration of social behavioral aspects with technical energy systems modeling, addressing a gap identified in previous climate-focused transition scenarios that often made overly optimistic assumptions by not fully considering behavioral changes induced by digitalization.\n\nDomain-specific terms and synonyms:\n- Digitalization (digital transformation)\n- ICTs (digital technologies, communication technologies)\n- Teleworking (remote work, home office)\n- Energy transition (energy system transformation)\n- Rebound effects (indirect energy consumption increases)\n- Agent-based modeling (ABM, multi-agent simulation)"

    "summary": "research paper on photovoltaic battery (PVB) systems in Switzerland:\n\nThe study presents a comprehensive techno-economic optimization model analyzing the financial viability of combined photovoltaic and battery storage systems across different Swiss consumer segments from 2020-2050. The research clusters customers based on key variables including annual electricity usage, available roof space, solar irradiation levels, and geographic location.\n\nThe methodology employs a static investment model with extensive sensitivity analysis examining multiple parameters like system costs, consumption patterns, electricity rates, and tariff structures. A notable finding is that PVB systems already provide better net present values (NPV) than standalone solar installations for certain customer segments, though payback periods show volatility between 2020-2035 due to policy changes and price developments.\n\nThe research demonstrates that optimal system sizing for both PV and batteries increases over time, with rooftop area becoming the primary limiting factor for solar installations by 2050. Economic attractiveness varies significantly across customer segments, with the most favorable returns typically available to consumers having higher annual solar exposure and electricity demand.\n\nThe study emphasizes the high sensitivity of investment decisions to factors like payback period requirements, future cost trajectories, electricity prices, and tariff evolution. The analysis also examines grid impacts through assessment of residual load profiles in the Swiss power system, highlighting the need for flexible, fast-ramping resources to manage seasonal and daily solar generation patterns.\n\nKey technical terms used include:\n- PVB (Photovoltaic Battery) systems\n- Net Present Value (NPV)\n- Self-consumption rate\n- Residual load profiles\n- Distribution System Operators (DSOs)\n- Injection tariffs/remunerations\n\nThis research would be particularly relevant for energy policy makers, utilities, solar developers, and consumers evaluating distributed energy investments in Switzerland or similar markets."

    "summary": "research article on strategic PV expansion in Switzerland:\n\nThe study examines two distinct strategies for expanding solar photovoltaic (PV) deployment in Switzerland, comparing an efficiency-focused approach that prioritizes the most productive rooftops with an equity-focused approach aimed at maximizing regional self-sufficiency. The research utilizes real hourly PV potential data for Switzerland's entire building stock and compares it against electricity demand profiles for residential and service sectors.\n\nKey findings reveal that achieving Switzerland's 2050 PV expansion target of 35 TWh requires utilizing at least 46% of suitable rooftops under the efficiency-focused strategy, primarily targeting large roofs with low tilt angles. This approach results in annual electricity self-sufficiency in approximately 40% of Swiss districts. The alternative equity-focused strategy, while requiring more extensive coverage (86% of suitable rooftops), increases the proportion of self-sufficient districts to over 70%.\n\nThe study introduces novel methodological contributions by bridging the gap between national-scale PV deployment assessments using standardized systems and regional-scale self-sufficiency studies of existing building stock. It employs detailed spatial analysis considering actual rooftop characteristics rather than simplified assumptions about PV panel orientation and tilt angles.\n\nDomain-specific terminology includes:\n- Photovoltaics (PV)/solar panels (synonyms: solar cells, solar modules)\n- Self-sufficiency (synonyms: energy independence, autonomous power supply)\n- Decentralized generation (synonyms: distributed generation, local power production)\n- Grid integration (synonyms: network connection, power system incorporation)\n\nThe research is particularly relevant for policymakers, utilities, and researchers interested in renewable energy deployment strategies, regional energy equity, and power system planning."
